  {
    "question": "What is a scientific theory?",
    "answer": "A scientific theory is the culmination of many scientific investigations drawing together all the current evidence concerning a substantial range of phenomena; thus, a scientific theory represents the most powerful explanation scientists have to offer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do theories become laws, or do laws become theories?",
    "answer": "Theories do not become laws, nor do laws become theories; theories are well-supported explanations and laws are well-supported descriptions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of an experiment?",
    "answer": "To test a hypothesis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is \"The keychain is yellow\" an inference or observation?",
    "answer": "Observation. It is a matter-of-fact statement that was made using one of the five senses."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is \"Hannah's favorite color is yellow because her keychain is yellow\" an inference or an observation?",
    "answer": "Inference. It is a conclusion drawn from an observation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the independent variable in Fredrick's rose experiment?",
    "answer": "The type of soil used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the dependent variable in Fredrick's rose experiment?",
    "answer": "The height of the plant and number of leaves."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the control group in Fredrick's rose experiment?",
    "answer": "Soil from Frederick's rose garden."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of using scientific models?",
    "answer": "Helps scientists visualize, represent, or explain natural phenomena."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the eight characteristics of life?",
    "answer": "Cells are the basic unit of life, growth and development, genetic code, use and obtain energy, reproduction, response to stimuli, homeostasis, and adaptation through evolution."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are viruses living or non-living?",
    "answer": "Non-living. They cannot reproduce on their own, need a host to obtain energy, and have no cells."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is primary succession?",
    "answer": "Landscape develops on bare rock (no pre-existing soil)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is secondary succession?",
    "answer": "Landscape develops on no pre-existing soil after a disturbance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 10% rule?",
    "answer": "Only 10% of energy moves up to the next trophic level."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does it mean when water molecules are described as \"polar\"?",
    "answer": "Have opposite charges in two different regions of the molecule."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of chemical bonds are inside a molecule of water?",
    "answer": "Covalent bonds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of chemical bonds link molecules of water to other molecules of water?",
    "answer": "Hydrogen bonds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of instrument do scientists use to study cells?",
    "answer": "Microscopes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are animal and plant cells eukaryotic or prokaryotic?",
    "answer": "Eukaryotic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the movement of molecules when the concentration of molecules inside and outside a membrane is the same?",
    "answer": "Water moves into and out of the cell at an equal rate. There is no longer any NET movement of water in one direction, water moves towards both directions equally."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to an animal cell (such as a red blood cell) when it is in a hypotonic solution?",
    "answer": "Water moves into the cell, which swells and bursts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What organelle does the aerobic portion of cellular respiration occur in?",
    "answer": "The mitochondria."
  },
  {
    "question": "What organelle does photosynthesis occur in?",
    "answer": "Chloroplasts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between ATP and ADP molecules?",
    "answer": "ATP has three phosphate groups and is higher energy than an ADP molecule. ADP has two phosphates and is lower energy than an ATP molecule."
  },
  {
    "question": "List the steps of cellular respiration in order.",
    "answer": "Glycolysis ---> Krebs cycle ---> Electron transport chain"
  },
  {
    "question": "How many ATP molecules are produced from 1 molecule of glucose during cellular respiration?",
    "answer": "38 ATP molecules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does cellular respiration occur in all cells?",
    "answer": "Yes, even bacteria (they just do not use a mitochondria)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when chlorophyll is struck by sunlight?",
    "answer": "The electrons in the chlorophyll become energized and absorb the sunlight."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are photosynthesis and cellular respiration connected?",
    "answer": "The formulas for the reactions are inverse. The reactants for photosynthesis are the products for cellular respiration, and vice versa."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which steps of cellular respiration are aerobic, and which are anaerobic?",
    "answer": "Glycolysis is anaerobic. Krebs cycle and ETC are aerobic. Fermentation is anaerobic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an autotroph?",
    "answer": "Organisms such as plants that make their food through processes such as photosynthesis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a heterotroph?",
    "answer": "Organisms such as humans that must consume other organisms as food."
